- 👋 Hi, I’m @asluborski
- 👀 My research/career interests are in neural networks, data, cybersecurity, and bioinformatics/ computer aided drug discovery. My hobby interests are
videogame design, operating systems, and reverse engineering
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer vision 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting open-source projects that can make an impact. I would also love to join a dedicated game development team/indie company as a     volunteer position, and maybe if things work, become part of the team. I am really picky about the games and worlds I am willing to work on but if I like the formula, I would pour my heart into it.
